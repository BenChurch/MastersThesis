  abstract  = {Motivation: Spinal needle injections are technically demand-
ing procedures. The use of ultrasound image guidance without prior CT
and MR imagery promises to improve the eﬃcacy and safety of these
procedures in an aﬀordable manner. Methodology: We propose to cre-
ate a statistical shape model of the lumbar spine and warp this atlas
to patient-speciﬁc ultrasound images during the needle placement proce-
dure. From CT image volumes of 35 patients, statistical shape model of
the L3 vertebra is built, including mean shape and main modes of vari-
ation. This shape model is registered to the ultrasound data by simul-
taneously optimizing the parameters of the model and its relative pose.
Ground-truth data was established by printing 3D anatomical models of
3 patients using a rapid prototyping. CT and ultrasound data of these
models were registered using ﬁducial markers. Results: Pairwise registra-
tion of the statistical shape model and 3D ultrasound images led to a
mean target registration error of 3.4 mm, while 81% of all cases yielded
clinically acceptable accuracy below the 3.5 mm threshold.},
