First, I would like to thank my supervisors, Dr. Gabor Fichtinger and Dr. Parvin Mousavi. Your continuous feedback on my work has made me a better researcher, writer, and student. Most importantly, both of you believed in me and this work, even when I did not. Thank you both for your guidance and supervision, without which I would surely have been lost trying to navigate the world of research.
I would also like to thank Dr. Tamas Ungi. Tamas, your endless technical and academic guidance have given me direction throughout the course of this degree. Thank you for providing the insight and foresight needed to steer my work in productive and meaningful directions.
Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family. Without your constant love and support, nothing I have done would have been possible. Thank you all for making everything possible and worthwhile.
